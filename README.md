# scratch_linear_regression
This repository demonstrates implementation of the infamous linear regression from scratch using numpy!

It includes the LinearRegression.py file that contains the LinearRegression class, and use of this class is demonstrated in the test_1.py file.

The tes_1.py file uses some helper functions from scikit learn to help create an artificial dataset and split it into training and testing sections.
